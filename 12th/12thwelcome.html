      <p><font color="#2f4f4f" size="3">On behalf of the organizing committee 
        and NPO International TRI Network, I would like to welcome you to the 
        12th Kamakura Live Demonstration Course held on December 16, 17 and 18th, 
        in Yokohama, Japan.<br>
        The Kamakura Live Demonstration Course makes a feature of Trans-Radial 
        Coronary Intervention (TRI). We hope that we could share our knowledge 
        and development about TRI and update our professional skills each other 
        during this meeting.<br>
        13 years have already passed since Dr. Kiemeneij first introduced TRI 
        in the world, and 10 years have passed since Dr. Saito introduced TRI 
        in Japan. During these 13 years, TRI has already established its most 
        important position in the recent advance in percutaneous coronary intervention. 
        However, on the other hand, there are many physicians emerging, who are 
        not promoting from their heart but only utilizing TRI for themselves. 
        Here, Dr. Saito would like to declare that he would be not false Radialist 
        but be true fighting Radialist. <br>
        This course has definitely continued to contribute to the spread of TRI 
        in Asian countries, especially in Japan. This year, we decided not only 
        to introduce the advanced techniques of TRI but also to come back again 
        to the beginning of TRI. I would like to characterize the Kamakura Live 
        Demonstration Course as with last year by including a special session 
        named ÅgDr. SakaiÅfs View on TRA and TRIÅh and ÅgYoung Ambitious DoctorsÅf 
        Live DemonstrationÅh. During these special sessions, we hope that we could 
        encourage young physicians to share their knowledge about TRA and TRI, 
        to promote and/or start TRA and TRI.<br>
        I believe that all of the attendants would find the 12th Kamakura Live 
        Demonstration Course as the most informative and worthwhile educational 
        experiences. I would like to express our sincere thanks for your participation 
        and hope you are encouraged to share your clinical experiences each other.</font></p>
